# 📘 Peit — RAG Knowledge Assistant

**Chat with your documents — get grounded, cited answers.**

A production-shaped Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) product: a full SaaS-style web app
(landing page, sign-up/login, dashboard with saved conversation history) on top of a FastAPI
RAG backend. Upload PDFs, text, or Markdown and query them in natural language — every answer
is generated **only** from the retrieved passages and cites its sources inline.

**▶ [Live demo](https://rag-knowledge-assistant-blue.vercel.app)** · deployed on Vercel

> **Runs in 60 seconds with zero API keys.** The project ships with an offline mode
> (deterministic embeddings + an extractive answerer) so you can clone, run, and see the
> full pipeline work immediately — then flip two env vars to switch to OpenAI embeddings
> and Claude for real semantic retrieval and generation.

## ✨ Features

- **Document ingestion** — PDF, TXT, and Markdown, with smart overlapping chunking.
- **Semantic retrieval** — cosine-similarity search over a persisted vector index.
- **Grounded answers with citations** — the model answers only from retrieved context and
  marks every claim with `[n]` source markers.
- **Token streaming** — answers stream to the UI over Server-Sent Events.
- **Pluggable providers** — swap embeddings (OpenAI ↔ offline) and the LLM (Claude ↔
  offline) behind clean interfaces; the vector store is equally swappable (Chroma /
  pgvector / Pinecone).
- **Full product UI ("Peit")** — a from-scratch, framework-free single-page app: animated
  marketing landing page, sign-up with **email verification codes** (+ **password reset**),
  Google/GitHub OAuth, and a dashboard with saved conversation history, **per-chat document
  uploads**, chat rename, a collapsible sidebar, a profile menu (manage account + settings),
  light + dark theme, and a fully responsive/mobile layout. *(Password auth and history are
  client-side — see the note below — so the live demo needs no database; email verification
  and OAuth are real backend flows.)*
- **Per-chat retrieval** — documents are uploaded into a specific conversation and answers
  are grounded only in that chat's files (the vector store is partitioned by collection).
- **Fully tested & CI-ready** — the whole pipeline is exercised offline; `pytest` passes
  with no keys and no network.

> **Note on auth & history.** To keep the public demo zero-backend, sign-up/login and chat
> history are implemented client-side (localStorage). The RAG endpoints (`/api/*`) are the
> real backend. For production, swap in a real auth provider (e.g. Clerk/Auth.js) and a
> database (e.g. Postgres/Neon) — the frontend is structured so this is a drop-in change.

**Retrieval pipeline:** `ingest → chunk → embed → index` then `embed query → retrieve
top-k → prompt with numbered context → generate with [n] citations`.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Option A — local (offline, no keys)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tornikepe/rag-knowledge-assistant.git
cd rag-knowledge-assistant

python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python scripts/ingest_sample.py       # optional: seed the bundled sample doc
uvicorn app.main:app --reload         # → http://localhost:8000
```

Open **http://localhost:8000**, upload a document, and start asking questions.

### Option B — Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build             # → http://localhost:8000
```

### Option C — Deploy to Vercel (one click)

The repo ships a `vercel.json` + serverless entry point (`api/index.py`). Import the
repo on Vercel and it deploys as-is — the live demo runs in offline mode (no keys) and
auto-seeds the sample document so it's queryable immediately.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/tornikepe/rag-knowledge-assistant)

> On serverless the vector index lives in `/tmp` (ephemeral), so uploads persist only
> within a warm instance — perfect for a demo. For durable storage, run it as a container
> or swap in a hosted vector DB behind the `VectorStore` interface.

### Enable real models (recommended)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

```ini
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-opus-4-8
```

The LLM is the part that "talks": set **`LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**
to get real Claude-generated answers (leave them unset to run the offline `echo`
answerer). The OpenAI embeddings above are optional — they improve retrieval, but
`hash` mode works with no key.

> **On Vercel** (or any host), set these as **Environment Variables** in the project
> settings instead of a `.env` file, then redeploy — env-var changes only take effect
> on the next deployment. The same applies to the OAuth and SMTP variables below.

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Variable             | Default              | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `hash`               | `hash` (offline) or `openai`                           |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL`    | `text-embedding-3-small` | OpenAI embedding model                             |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | —                    | Required when `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`               |
| `LLM_PROVIDER`       | `echo`               | `echo` (offline) or `anthropic`                        |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`    | `claude-opus-4-8`    | Claude model for generation                            |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | —                    | Required when `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`                  |
| `CHUNK_SIZE`         | `900`                | Target characters per chunk                            |
| `CHUNK_OVERLAP`      | `150`                | Overlap between adjacent chunks                         |
| `TOP_K`              | `4`                  | Chunks retrieved per query                              |
| `STORAGE_DIR`        | `storage`            | Where the vector index is persisted                    |

## 🔐 Real Google / GitHub OAuth (optional)

The login popup's **Continue with Google / GitHub** buttons use real OAuth 2.0 when
configured, and fall back to a demo login otherwise — so the app works out of the box and
"upgrades" the moment you add credentials. The backend (`app/api/auth.py`) runs the
Authorization Code flow and issues a signed session cookie; nothing extra is needed on the
client.

To enable it:

1. **Create the OAuth apps** and copy each client id + secret:
   - **Google** — [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) →
     *Create Credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application*.
   - **GitHub** — [Developer settings → OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers) →
     *New OAuth App*.
2. **Set the redirect (callback) URLs** to your deployment, exactly:
   - `https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback`
   - `https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/auth/github/callback`
3. **Set the environment variables** (locally in `.env`, or in the Vercel project settings):
   ```ini
   SESSION_SECRET=<a long random string>
   OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE=https://<your-app>.vercel.app
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   ```

`GET /api/auth/providers` reports which providers are live. Auth routes: `/api/auth/{provider}/login`,
`/api/auth/{provider}/callback`, `/api/auth/me`, `/api/auth/logout`.

> The vector index is partitioned by **collection** (one per chat) behind the `VectorStore`
> interface, so uploads only affect the conversation they were added to. Extending the same
> mechanism to per-user scoping is a small change.

## 📧 Email sign-up verification (optional SMTP)

Sign-up emails a **6-digit code** to the address being registered, and the same flow powers
**"Forgot password?"** on the login screen. Configure SMTP to turn it on; without it, email
sign-up and reset are disabled and users sign in with Google/GitHub instead.

Set these (in `.env` locally, or the Vercel project settings — then redeploy):

```ini
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=you@gmail.com          # the full address that sends the mail (required)
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password  # see the Gmail note below
SMTP_FROM=you@gmail.com          # optional; defaults to SMTP_USER
SMTP_STARTTLS=true
```

> **Gmail:** use an **App Password**, not your account password. Turn on 2-Step Verification,
> create one at [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords),
> and paste the 16 characters **without spaces**. All three of `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, and
> `SMTP_PASSWORD` must be set. (Vercel's serverless functions *can* send over SMTP — the port
> isn't blocked.)

The code is carried in a short-lived HMAC-signed token, so no database is needed. Endpoints:
`POST /api/auth/signup/start`, `POST /api/auth/signup/verify`.

## 🔌 API

Interactive OpenAPI docs are served at **`/docs`**.

| Method   | Endpoint             | Description                                    |
| -------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/health`        | Status, providers, and index size              |
| `POST`   | `/api/ingest`        | Upload & index a document (multipart; optional `collection`) |
| `POST`   | `/api/query`         | Ask a question → answer + citations (JSON; optional `collection`) |
| `POST`   | `/api/query/stream`  | Same, streamed as Server-Sent Events           |
| `GET`    | `/api/documents`     | List indexed documents (optional `?collection=`) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/documents`     | Clear the index                                |

```bash
# Ingest, then ask:
curl -F "file=@data/sample_docs/ai_automation_overview.md" http://localhost:8000/api/ingest
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is RAG and why does it matter?"}' | jq
```

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
pytest            # offline: no API keys, no network
```

Covers chunking, the vector store (ranking + persistence), and the full API flow
(ingest → query → stream → clear) via FastAPI's `TestClient`.

## 🧠 Design notes

- **Why a hand-written vector store?** Retrieval is just normalized dot products over a
  matrix — implementing it directly makes the mechanics legible and keeps the dependency
  footprint tiny. It sits behind a `VectorStore` interface, so moving to Chroma, pgvector,
  or Pinecone is a one-class change.
- **Why offline providers?** So the repo is genuinely runnable and CI-testable without
  secrets. The provider abstraction is the same one used for the real OpenAI/Claude
  implementations — nothing is faked at the seams.
- **Grounding & citations.** Retrieved chunks are numbered in the prompt and the model is
  instructed to answer only from them and cite with `[n]`; the API returns the matching
  source list so the UI can render verifiable sources.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Hybrid search (BM25 + dense) and re-ranking
- [x] Per-collection indexes (per-chat document scoping)
- [ ] Per-user multi-tenant indexes + durable storage
- [ ] Streaming citation highlights in the UI
- [ ] Pluggable Chroma / pgvector backends behind the existing interface
